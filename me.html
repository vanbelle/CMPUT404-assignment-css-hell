				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img class="FloatImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9437242/12989742/df90a1e0-d0c3-11e5-9b0f-962dab3071f1.jpeg" alt="Picture Of Me" position="absolute" top="10%">
				<p>I am a fourth year computing science student and will soon graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree with a computer 
				science specialization. My favorite things to work on are UIs and databases. I chose a degree in computer science because I
				love solving problems and finding unique solutions to whatever task I am currently working on. My years working on high school committees have given me a
				knowledge of how to prioritize the most pressing task and coordinate with a group of people. 
				Overall I have developed the ability to solve complex problems efficiently and thoroughly.</p>

			<h2>Skills and Abilities</h2>
			<p>In school we have covereed programming languages such as Java, Javascript, C/++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, LISP and Prolog, as well as experience in object-oriented programming,
