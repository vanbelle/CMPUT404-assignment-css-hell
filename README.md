Part I
=================
To run the css file on the gutenberg pages, I added  

link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://rawgit.com/vanbelle/CMPUT404-assignment-css-hell/master/gutenberg.css">
link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/vanbelle/CMPUT404-assignment-css-hell/master/gutenberg.css">
 into the header of the html.  
 
The CSS file makes the following modifications:  
 - The file background color was changed to OldLace
 - A stylized border was added to then entire html document
 - Solid black borders were added around images, and any captions were italicized.
 - Headers were center aligned
 - The first letter in the first paragraph was enlarged, bolded and italicized for emphasis
